Hi! I'm Heng-Jui Chang (張恆瑞), a research assistant at the National Taiwan University (NTU) <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speech Processing and Machine Learning Lab</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hung-yi Lee</a>.
My research interests are in machine learning and speech processing.
I am currently working on **speech recognition** and **self-supervised learning**.

I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from NTU in Jun 2021.
I was an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speech Processing Lab</a> supervised by Prof. <a href="http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lin-shan Lee</a> and Prof. <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hung-yi Lee</a> from Mar 2019 to Jun 2021.

I'm seeking opportunities to study for a Ph.D. starting from 2022 fall!
